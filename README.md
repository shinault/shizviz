# shizviz

Interactive visualizations can be very helpful for students studying probability
and statistics.  The `shizviz` package provides some Shiny apps that facilitate
this.

You can install this package using `devtools` at the R command line.  First, 
make sure that `devtools` is installed.
```r
install.packages("devtools")
```
Then use the `install_github` function to install the package from GitHub.
```r
devtools::install_github("shinault/shizviz")
```
